# Kernighan-Ritchie-Exercises

Hello. My name is Adam and I am in the process of learning about the C programming language. One of the most recommended books about this topic is titled, "The C Programming Language", written by authors Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. This repository is my attempt at solving some of the exercises that are present in the book. This repository is not all inclusive and does not contain the solutions for every problem found in the book, it contains only the problems that I have attempted to solve. If you have any questions or comments or find any errors in my code, feel free to make any branches and pull requests to make this code better. Cheers. 

As a side note, the book that I am using is the second version of the book. Here is more detailed information for anyone interested:
